# Using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for QA End-to-End Testing

See my **[test code](/cypress/e2e/price.cy.js)** here.

To showcase my skill on using Cypress to automatically click through a browser, I wrote this JavaScript test code to check prices with different plans on Verisart.

My code tests these steps:

1. Visit Verisart Pricing page
2. Choose 'Pay monthly' or 'Pay yearly'
3. Choose 'Individuals' or 'Businesses'
4. Check the price on the Starter plan
5. Check the price on the Premium plan
6. Check the price on the Pro plan
